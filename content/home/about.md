# HELLO

I am a PhD student in Bioengineering at the University of Maryland's Functional Macromolecular Laboratory. My advisor is Dr. Peter Kofinas, an expert in polymer science and current Professor and Chair of the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. 

Research projects that I have worked on include:

(1) a biodegradable, body temperature responsive polymer surgical sealant
(2) investigating the tissue adhesion of polymer nanocomposites
(3) sprayable and antimicrobial wound dressings
(4) studying the molecular parameters that affect solution blow spinning

I am also interested in drug delivery systems, the immunological response to biomaterials, and hydrogels.
