abstract = "Wound closure devices prevent excessive blood loss and exposure to pathogens, whether for internal or external use. Conformal, adhesive dressings improve upon conventional wound closure devices such as sutures by minimizing collateral damage to tissue and providing a leak-proof seal. In this work, we demonstrate how solution blow spinning (SBS) can be used to spray-deliver polymer composite dressings in situ--and how the composite element delivers advanced functionality, either by (1) releasing silver ions to prevent infection or (2) by incorporating silica particles to reduce coagulation time. Both approaches utilize a body temperature-responsive biodegradable polymer blend of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA/PEG) with minimal cytotoxicity."
